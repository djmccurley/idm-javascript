 My final project for MCAD Web Dev: JS and jQuery is a web app that allows the user to encode and decode secret messages to send to their friends. It is geared towards kids and adults just for fun, with a heavy influence from 80's action movies, as well as the GI Joe cartoons.

One of the challenges for freeCodeCamp was to write a function that translates an "encoded" string into plain English using a Caeser Cipher - ie. a code that offsets the letters of the alphabet by a certain number (A=P, B=Q, C=R, etc.) This original function is included in a comment in script.js.

Using that similar process, I built a complete app with the following functionality:

Core functions:

User can enter text in English and get the output encoded with a Caeser Cipher (encode)

User can enter an encoded message and receive the plain English output (decode)

User can manually change the mode between ENCODE and DECODE

User can tweet or copy the output to the clipboard

User can change the "Code Channel" - ie. change the offset value of the code being used (A=P or A=Q or A=R) between a few options. This would let friends only speak on the same "channel"

User can type in text and see the output live as they type (or relatively quickly after they type)

I used the following technologies to build the app:

HTML
CSS/Sass
Javascript
jQuery
clipboard.js
